gitrelay
========
A simple webhook receiver that listens to a remote git repository changes and deploys files received via a POST request to predefined locations on the local machine or a remote one.

Basic (continuous-integration) scenario: files updated in a Bitbucket repository are pushed to a server on AWS.
